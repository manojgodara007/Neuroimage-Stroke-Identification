## Introduction
In this paper, we propose a machine learning-based diagnostic model for stroke identification using neuroimages. The model leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks for prediction.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- scikit-learn

## Result
The model achieved an accuracy of X% on the test dataset. Detailed evaluation metrics and results can be found in the paper.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
