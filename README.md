## Introduction
In this paper, we propose a machine learning-based diagnostic model for stroke identification using neuroimages. The model leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks for prediction.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- scikit-learn

## Dataset
- [Brain CT Images with Intracranial Hemorrhage Masks](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vbookshelf/computed-tomography-ct-images/data)

## Result
The model achieved an accuracy of 61.27%. We are working to achieve a 96.28% accuracy, as demonstrated in the paper.
